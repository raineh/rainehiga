## Bio

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at SUNY-ESF, working on new tools to make complex, 
broad-scale systems easier for humans to understand. 
Right now, that means I split my time between predictive modeling
(to [monitor forest carbon sequestration across New York State](https://cafri-ny.org/new-york-forest-carbon-assessment/), 
[track the development of early-successional forests](https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2022.2155086), 
and more) and visualization (including
[using game engines as a GIS](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Smardon/publication/355972101_VRSC_2021_Conference_Proceedings_VRSC_2021_Conference_Proceedings/links/6186bf0e07be5f31b74fa3c1/VRSC-2021-Conference-Proceedings-VRSC-2021-Conference-Proceedings.pdf#page=74) and
[making it easier to make reproducible VR environments for research](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04388)).
By training I'm either an ecologist (specializing in landscape and 
translational ecology) or environmental scientist; professionally, I've worked
as a data analyst, software engineer, and chicken farmer.
